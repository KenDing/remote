DACP Remote Control
===================


The Digital Audio Control Protocol (DACP) was recently introduced by Apple, and is built into all
recent iTunes versions. DACP is the protocol used by the Remote app on the iPhone/iPod Touch to 
remote control your desktop or laptop iTunes player.

DACP is similar to the well-known DAAP, using Bonjour MDNS to find libraries, then using HTTP 
requests with binary responses to transfer data. After a few days in front of packet dumps, I have
most of DACP decoded.

With the protocol now reverse engineered, I wrote an Android client in about a week. Now you can
remote control your iTunes from your new Android phone when it arrives later this year. This works
out of the box without installing any extra software on your PC or Mac. Here's a quick video in 
action on the emulator:

If you're interested in jumping right in, here's an APK ready to install. Also, the full source has 
been released under a GPLv3 license, and you can grab it from Subversion on Google Code:
