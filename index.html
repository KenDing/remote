== DACP Remote Control

The Digital Audio Control Protocol (DACP) was recently introduced by Apple, and is built into all
recent iTunes versions. DACP is the protocol used by the Remote app on the iPhone/iPod Touch to 
remote control your desktop or laptop iTunes player.

DACP is similar to the well-known DAAP, using Bonjour MDNS to find libraries, then using HTTP 
requests with binary responses to transfer data. Remote is an attempt to build a full featured 
Python/GTK client to control iTunes and other DACP enabled players.

I used the good work of Jeffrey Sharkey http://dacp.jsharkey.org/ to figure out the protocol
as well as the pairing code from http://jinxidoru.blogspot.com/2009/06/itunes-remote-pairing-code.html
This works out of the box without installing any extra software on your PC or Mac.

I have most of the network functionality now working, and I need to spend some efforts on the user 
interface and the Bonjour discovery and pairing.


== Status

Developped on Linux and Mac OS, can't get pygtk to compile on Mac OS unfortunately, that makes 
things difficult. Supports avahi on linux and uses pybonjour on Mac os

== Todo

Most UI buttons are not working as expected, it needs a lot of revamps.
